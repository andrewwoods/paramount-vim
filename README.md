# Paramount Vim 

__A Vim/Neovim theme inspired by Paramount__ 

This is currently a dark theme inspired by the branding used on Paramount+, the
streaming service. I wanted to make a Vim theme for coding on Paramount code,
to help set the mood. Accessibility is important, so there should always be
enough contrast for the text to be readable.
